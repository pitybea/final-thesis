\chapter{Conclusion and outlook}
\label{chp6}

In Chapter \ref{chp3}, a method to efficiently combine motion and appearance information is proposed. The method gives promising results under simple scenarios. To improve the results of Chapter \ref{chp3} on complex scenarios, in Chapter \ref{chp4}, the Hough transform framework is extended to incorporate motion information, and performs well on two datasets. Still the Hough transform framework itself is troublesome when considering about efficiency and effective. This lead to the method of Chapter \ref{chp5}, which is a brand new framework, and is very different in the using of visual and spatial information. The method's effectiveness is proven by experiments, and also it is theoretically promising.

Visual object detection by computers is still and, in near future, continues to be a very open problem. A very hopeful effort would be combining motion, appearance and location information of local features in a robust voting system.
