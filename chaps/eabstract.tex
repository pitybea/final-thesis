Object detection is a fundamental perceptual skill in human, and plays an important role in the machine vision area. There are two main categories of detection methods: methods using the sliding-window schema and methods based on Hough transforms. Among the methods, recent research improves detection performance by proposing better representative model, better classifiers, and better solution space search methods. We, in our work, propose four methods, of which two make use of motion information by combining it effectively and efficiently with appearance information, and two make use of the mutual information encoded among the image features of the same object.
