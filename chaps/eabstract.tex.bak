Object detection is a fundamental perceptual skill in human, and plays an important role in machine vision area. Successful object detection can help with video surveillance, driving assistance, etc.  

Most state-of-the-art detection methods belong to two main categories: methods using the sliding-window schema and methods based on Hough transforms. Recent researcher improve detection performance by proposing better representative models, better classifiers, or more efficient method for exploring solution space.


In our work, we try to improve the performance of object detection methods from a different aspect. We explore the information which are not made fully use of by previous methods. And our efforts are two-fold: 1) utilizing of motion information by combining it effectively and efficiently with appearance information, and 2) utilizing of mutual information encoded among the image features of the same object. 

Firstly, we propose a very efficient method for detection by combining motion information and appearance information.
