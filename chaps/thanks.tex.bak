First and foremost, I would like to thank my advisor, Professor Katsushi Ikeuchi. It is a great honor for me to be a Ph.D. student of Professor Ikeuchi. He leads me in my research. He shows to me how a top researcher works. He helps and comforts me during my most tough times. He gives me the chance to enjoy my research and my life in Japan. For me, Professor Ikeuchi is more than an advisor in research, and also an advisor in life. The tree years I spend in Ikeuchi lab is a lifelong treasure.

I would like to thank Dr Masataka Kagesawa, and Associate Professor Shintaro Ono for co-advising me. They are patient with my questions, they lead me and help me in my research, they help me in my personal affairs. They help me in a way I cannot appreciate more. While being co-advisors, they are also friends. I would also like to thank Dr Atsuhiko Banno, who gives me suggestions and helps me in my research.

I would like to thank Associate Professor Takeshi Oishi, Dr Bo Zheng, and Dr Rei Kawakami of computer vision lab. Thank them for their help in research and life during my Ph.D. period. I would like to thank Mr Yoshihiro Sato, Mr Kiminori Hasegawa, Ms Keiko Motoki,  Ms Yoshiko Matsuura, Ms Mikiko Yamaba, and Ms Yuko Nishine for their help.
