Detecting objects of interest from a complex scene is a basic perceptual skill in human beings and other animals.
While in the area of computer science, object detection~\cite{dod} is a computer technology that deals with detecting instances of semantic objects of a certain class (such as humans, buildings, or cars) in digital images and videos. And successful object detection
methods play fundamental roles in a lot of application areas, which include video surveillance, driving assistance, image retrieval, etc.
 


In computer vision, lots of researchers focus on object detection from images.
