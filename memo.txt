Dear Wang Zhipeng
(cc Ikeuchi)

I am responsible for your Ph.D thesis committee.

Would you report your progress?
Do you plan to get degree this summer?
If so, you have to submit your thesis by June 14.

Please also discuss with Prof Ikeuchi
about the thesis committee members
and send recommendations to me.

Please also send me the abstract of your thesis.
(not official. I just want to know your work)

thank you
Takeo iIgarashi
